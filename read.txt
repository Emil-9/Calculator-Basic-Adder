----------- Work Requirements ------------
simple React calculator (adder) has the following mandatory functionalities:

1- rows can be added and removed
2- each row have a sign (minus or plus)
3- each row can be enabled or disabled by a dedicated control button. Disabled rows must be excluded from the addition.
4- The result must be updated "live" while the user is writing


---------- Main Features -------------
1- This project is built using ReactJs Functional components.
3- custom hook 'useAccumulator' for accumulating the passed data array.
4- For any future project requirement I used reduxJS store and its toolkit for making the the data global and pass it to any component.
5- the Redux store has 3 Reducers (adding new row - updating the value of a row - removing an item from the array).
